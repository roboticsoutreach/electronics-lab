# Electronics Lab

This repository contains the LaTeX source code of a worksheet for an electronics
laboratory. It was created for the 2016 Smallpeice Microelectronics summer
school, but could have wider applications. Although the tasks integrate quite
heavily with the Student Robotics V3 kit (not commercially available), the tasks
could be modified to work with an Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc.

The file `bom.yaml` contains a structured list of necessary materials, including
tools, components and consumables. Farnell order codes are given for most items.
